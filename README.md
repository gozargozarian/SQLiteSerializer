A C# Serializer for storing objects to a SQLite Database in a human-readable format
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Current Status: **ALPHA** - No deserializing yet, but soon.

The goal of this project was to be able to serialize an object to a SQLite database
and visually be able to inspect the tables and columns to see your type stored
inside.

When the project is completed, it will handle complex objects, arrays, and
sub-objects.
